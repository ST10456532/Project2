I was requested to design my own version of the famous Tamagotchi App for Android.This App is going to allow users to have an online pet that they have to care of.

I started by creating the welcoming Interface. I had to go on google and download a picture of a dog , not just any dog though , the dog had to look friendly to ensure that it doesnt it scare any users to the point where they dont want to continue using the app.
So i picked a brown furry dog, it didnt look intimidating at all . Another reason for picking a dog as my background for the Tamagotchi App is because the main objective of the app is to take care of an online pet.

My welcoming page consists of a picture of my Pet, in the normal white background  with the name of the App in big font sizes. I added a button called Woof That is going to take the User from the Welcoming Page to the Second Page where taking care of the pet begins. 

The Second Page consists of three signficant sections of taking care of a pet in normal everyday life , hunger, Cleanliness and Happiness. So i created buttons that will satisfy all three of the significant sections of taking care of a pet.
 The first one is Hunger,  when your pet is hungry you have give it food and this were the button comes in  i named the button Feed so that none of my users will have to go through any complicated process just click feed and a image of the pet eating will be shown.
 This will decrease the levels of hunger your dog will be experiencing

 The second one is Cleanliness, Your pet has to be clean because how you take care of your pet is a reflection of who you are as person . You cannot bath everyday and think you a clean person too and you dont wash your pet. So washing your pet is of high importance . 
 Cleanliness is going to  show how clean your pet is if it is too low then you have to click the button Clean this will show you an image of the dog being cleaned thus increase its levels of Cleanliness.![image]

The Third one is Happiness keeping your dog happy increases its bond with you and in turn increases your bond with it so when your dogs happiness levels are decreasing the only way to keep your dog is to play with it . This is why i added the button  Play  so when you 
click the button the play it will show you an image of the Dog happy this means that its levels of happiness are gonna increase.
